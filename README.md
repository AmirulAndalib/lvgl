# Pitches

The feature ideas of LVGL are discussed in GitHub issues, and converted into pitches. The pitches can be developed by anyone. To see if a pitch is already taken, checkout its Issue.

## Terminology

- **Shaping:** Convert raw ideas into something that can be developed. It includes examining opportunities, finding similar feature requests, roughly planning how it shall be implemented, tested, and taught through docs and examples.
- **Pitch:** A document that is the result of shaping.

## Content of this repository

- `pitch_*.md`: pitches to be developed.
- `vX.Y` folders: contains the LVGL versions in which the pitch was added
- `__pitch_template`: new pitches should be created from it
